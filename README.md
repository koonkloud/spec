# KoonKloud Wiki

Welcome to the wiki for the KoonKloud. This repo includes everything you need to know to get fully up to date with what this system is.

## Abstract

The goal of the KoonKloud is to unify a user's services, devices, and knowledge, into a single language controllable through dynamically generated interfaces.

The system should understand abstract concepts such as `Person`, `Song`, `Light`, rather than `InstagramProfile`, `SpotifyTrack`, `PhilipsHueDevice`, similar to how humans understand them, and then use service APIs to interface with the abstract concepts.
